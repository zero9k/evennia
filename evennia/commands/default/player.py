"""
Player (OOC) commands. These are stored on the Player object
and self.caller is thus always a Player, not an Object/Character.

These commands go in the PlayerCmdset and are accessible also
when puppeting a Character (although with lower priority)

These commands use the player_caller property which tells the command
parent (MuxCommand, usually) to setup caller correctly. They use
self.player to make sure to always use the player object rather than
self.caller (which change depending on the level you are calling from)
The property self.character can be used to access the character when
these commands are triggered with a connected character (such as the
case of the @ooc command), it is None if we are OOC.

Note that under MULTISESSION_MODE > 2, Player commands should use
self.msg() and similar methods to reroute returns to the correct
method. Otherwise all text will be returned to all connected sessions.
